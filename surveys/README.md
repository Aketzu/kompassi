# Survey application

This is an application that lets you make generic ad-hoc surveys using [Survey.js](https://github.com/surveyjs/surveyjs). They have a [visual survey builder](http://surveyjs.org/builder/) to help you create the form.

## Tips

When copying & pasting the survey from the survey builder to Kompassi, remember to select `Generate valid JSON` instead of `Generate readable JSON` from `Options`.

Remember to set the `completeText` or `completeHtml` property of the query in the query builder. This controls the text we display to the user after completion.
